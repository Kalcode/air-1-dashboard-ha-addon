Icon Requirements for Home Assistant Addon
==========================================

The addon requires an icon.png file for display in the Home Assistant add-on store.

Requirements:
- File name: icon.png
- Dimensions: 512x512 pixels (recommended)
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Theme: Should represent air quality monitoring (e.g., air filter, sensor, particles)
- Style: Match Home Assistant's Material Design aesthetic

Suggested Design Ideas:
- Air filter icon with quality indicator
- Sensor device illustration
- Particulate matter visualization
- Combination of air quality symbols

You can:
1. Create a custom icon using tools like Figma, Inkscape, or Adobe Illustrator
2. Use Material Design Icons (mdi:air-filter) as inspiration
3. Find royalty-free icons from sources like:
   - Material Design Icons (https://materialdesignicons.com/)
   - The Noun Project (https://thenounproject.com/)
   - Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/)

Once you have your icon:
- Save it as icon.png in this directory
- Ensure it's 512x512 pixels
- Test by building the addon and checking the Supervisor interface

Optional:
- logo.png (optional, 512x512) - Used for documentation and branding
